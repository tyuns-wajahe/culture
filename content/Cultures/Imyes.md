The **Imyes**, later Igiich, are a historical group of Wajahic peoples. Once widespread across the [[Zitis]] steppe and southern forests, they now exist as a few scattered bands of nomads east of [[Tsynzkyy]] with no organized states or institutions and without any centralized cohesion to speak of.

Known as the t͡swɛzt͡sř̩ʋ to Wajahe of the south, The Jağefj are group of people living in Efj, the 'Land of Eafáis,' the semi-arid foothills of the Tsazziš mountain range, as well as (more recently) the Eastern Steppe. Originally a group of [[Tswezets|Efelöhians]], and speaking a language closely related to theirs, they are culturally similar to the Wajahe. The Jağefj have been heavily influenced by the [[Tanlhawes|T’anlhawes]] people to their north, following a religion derived from theirs; since the collapse of the Confederation of Iron Hooves, there has been a marked increase in [[Imyes|Igiichi]] influence.

## Jağefj Language

The Jağefj language, known formally as Jağefjāz or Jağefjāz Rešadzekw, and informally as Rešadzinn, is an Efic language spoken by the Jağefj. It shares much of its core vocabulary and grammar with the language of the Efelöhians, from which it is descended. A significant amount of its vocabulary has been borrowed from the language of the T’anlhawes, as well as a smaller but noticeable amount from the late form of the Igiichi language, which enjoyed a few hundred years as a prestige language among the Jağefj, a role now increasingly taken on by Whiterun Wajahe.

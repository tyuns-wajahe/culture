The Riverine Culture, or the Rivermen, were a major culture along the [[Great River]] of [[Zitis]]. Until their [decline](Decline%20of%20the%20Riverine%20Civilization), they were the dominant cultural force in [[Zitis]], and also the largest and most populous culture. The first civilization to sedenterize and urbanize, they greatly influenced the cultures of the Wajahe, [[Ejee]], [[Dajitti]] (and earlier [[Zuu6]]), [[Imyes]], and [[Wzetsyew]]. They pioneered the major regional and international trade routes, including the [[Purple Road]], and would lay the groundwork for much of the modern economic strength of the Wajahe. There were 3 groupings of the Rivermen - the Yisa, Wisa, and Gwesa, corresponding roughly to the Lower, Middle, and Upper sections of the great river.

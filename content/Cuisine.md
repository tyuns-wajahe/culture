### Cured Lamb with Yogurt & Flatbreads


![[Cured lamb with yogurt and flatbread.png]]
*A meal from [whiterun](Whiterun%20(city)), cured lamb served with a wheat flatbread and a sauce of garlic and goat cheese.

*The lamb or mutton is placed in a jar or amphora. A curing liquid is prepared consisting of salt, honey, dill, garlic, and tarragon. This liquid is first brought to a boil, whereupon it is poured into the jar containing the lamb, which is stirred to expose the surface of the meat for curing. The container is sealed and left in a cool place to cure for a few days, but it must be inspected for signs of rot, and shaken occasionally. The meat is removed, rinsed, and cooked with a pan, after which it is served with a wheat flatbread and a garlic-yogurt.*

### Kumis

*A Standard Wajahic Kumis, prepared from Goat’s milk rather than the more common [mare’s milk](Horse).*

*The milk is scalded, then cooled until warm. The culture of kumis or yogurt is introduced to a small batch of the milk, which is introduced back to the remainder of the milk. It is covered and fermented for up to 1 day. Whisk the milk as it has separated, adding honey to fortify, and allow to continue fermenting in a cool place for another day. Whisk the milk again, adding further sweetness with honey, before serving (whereupon it may be whisked again)*

### Garlic Bread

While the cuisine of the Wajahe is as varied as the color of the horse hʐɔwhʷɔk hʷywt͡sʷøsøl (bread of garlic) is the centerpiece of any Wajahe meal. Considered a delicacy among foreigners, hʐɔwhʷɔk hʷywt͡sʷøsøl is served in every formal setting with a foreigner from trade to negotiations over tribute. After all, when a man is fed with the food of the gods, they will surely be more than amenable to a favorable deal. Within a Wajahe home, it is rare for a day to go by without it being served. It is never the centerpiece of a meal, and always a side item, much to the dismay of all Wajahe children who wish they could eat just hʐɔwhʷɔk hʷywt͡sʷøsøl all their lives.

The eating of hʐɔwhʷɔk hʷywt͡sʷøsøl

Whenever hʐɔwhʷɔk hʷywt͡sʷøsøl is made, parents must warn the kids that the food is hot. The kids will, of course, ignore this warning and eat it fresh out of the oven, burning their mouths. This is traditional, and it is a sign of bad parenting to wait until it is cool enough to eat before serving it to a child.

hʐɔwhʷɔk hʷywt͡sʷøsøl is omnipresent in Wajahe culture. It is the centerpiece of any social gathering, party, or meeting of friends. During an important event in a person’s life, it is inevitable that hʐɔwhʷɔk hʷywt͡sʷøsøl will be served. hʐɔwhʷɔk hʷywt͡sʷøsøl is the preferred meal of warriors returning home, especially when they have come from foreign lands bereft of garlic. It is believed that any Wajahe warrior would rather take his own life than go a season without a taste of hʐɔwhʷɔk hʷywt͡sʷøsøl. 

### Bustard

*Bustard served with Cured Pork*

**Ingredients:**
Goats (or mare’s) milk
Duck (or goat) fat
Flour
(Ground) Black mustard grains
Salt
Optional - Honey

**Instructions:**
- In a pot, heat some (120ml for one serving) milk without boiling.
- In a pan, heat a spoonful of fat (medium heat). Then, gradually add a spoonful of flour whilst whisking to create a roux.
- Add the milk a splash at a time, whisking vigorously throughout to prevent clumping, until all milk has been added to form the base of the sauce.
- Add the ground mustard grains, and whisk again to integrate. Add salt at this point.
- If the mustard is not hot and pungent enough to justify being taken as a hot sauce, sweeten the sauce with honey to balance out the sourness.

*Wheat flatbread with mushrooms, cheese curds, and pumpkin*

The flatbread is made from a wheat-based dough, cooked in an iron skillet. Flat mushrooms are then cooked in the same skillet, and the flatbread is placed atop them as they are cooked to absorb released moisture. Pumpkins are roasted in lard, coated in herbs, and then placed atop the flatbread. There is an accompaniment of coagulated cheese curds.

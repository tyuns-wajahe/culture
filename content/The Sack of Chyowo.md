**The Sack of Chyowo**, taking place in 2259 KS, took place after a war between [[Chyowo Clan]] and [[Yerzhay Clan]].

War between ʈ͡ʂʷɥɔwɔ and ɥəʐəɥ was nothing new - like all Wajahe, there was a history of border skirmishes and minor battles, that never amounted to much. This war started out similarly, with a blood feud over neighboring settlements across the border escalating to a larger border clash. However, the central battle across those border plains would end up being a decisive clash.

During the border clash, ʈ͡ʂʷɥɔwɔ decided to deploy their armies in a spread out line, while ʈ͡ʂʷɥɔwɔ picked a normal arrangement. The hope for ʈ͡ʂʷɥɔwɔ was quick and easy flanking, but the ɥəʐəɥ lancers quickly chased away the chariots and javelin cavalry, then pushed forward, leading to a quick rout. This was followed up by a series of battles in which the entire ʈ͡ʂʷɥɔwɔ army was killed or captured. 

With this decisive victory, ɥəʐəɥ was finally able to escalate the border conflict, and ʈ͡ʂʷɥɔwɔ, after a few insignificant battles, was eventually defeated and conquered outright. The city was sacked, but did not suffer significant infrastructural damage, and remained an important regional site.

After this war, the [[4th Dynasty]] state would emerge, centered originally in the ɥəʐəɥ clan, though it would very quickly become a cooperative endeavor by the ɥəʐəɥ and ʈ͡ʂʷɥɔwɔ.

Dams, based on the systems of [[Koshayis]] and [[Nodotto]], are widespread across the smaller rivers dotting Wajahe land. The purpose of these dams is to place further controls upon seasonal flooding - though the flood periods of the [[Great River]] are regular and predictable, this is not always true of its many tributaries. They also create reservoirs to act as water storage in the case of a drought, and irrigation systems plug directly into these. These dams come with fish-ladders, which allow for upstream migration of the salmon - essential not only for the food source they represent but also for the integrity of [[The Afterlife]]. Dams often have a bridge built atop them, serving as a primary crossing over the river for that portion. These bridges are tall wooden arches, and typically made with as small a slope as possible and with thick, sturdy supports (in case the bridge is wider than the dam) to allow for easy horse and wagon crossings.

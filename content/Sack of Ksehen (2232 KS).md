*Not to be confused with the [[Sack of Ksehen]]*

The **Sack of Ksehen** in 2232 KS was an event early in the [[First Intermediate Period]], and caused [[Ksehen Clan]] to fade into irrelevance, and [[Hkshit Clan]] to rise in its place.

Ksɛhen was once the center of the Wajahe world, but after the decline of the [1st Dynasty](Ksehen%20Clan#The%20First%20Dynasty), it was just one city among many, with only the presence of the [[Oracle]] to distinguish it. The old order, looking back at centuries of history with their dominance taking center stage, decided that it was time to reclaim their ancestral glory. They attacked their neighbors to the south-east in a surprise attack with no provocation, hoping for a swift conquest.

[hisit͡se](Hisitse%20Clan), arranging their armies after a last minute alert, were totally caught off guard by a concentrated deployment. However, the chariots and javelin cavalry of hisit͡se were able to flank and attack the ksɛhen cavalry, who were not quick enough on their charge to respond. After the routing of the enemy cavalry, the rest of the army fell to pieces quickly, and purple advanced, victorious. Key in this battle were the legendary 50 convicts, who gained a chance to free themselves with a suicidal cavalry charge at the enemy ranged cavalry. This succeeded beyond their wildest dreams - only 14 fell, and these warriors routed most of the enemy cavalry (including the [ʈ͡ʂɨʐɭ-oracle](Chuzde)’s bodyguard) single-handedly and entered the annals of great Wajahe warriors. 

Retaliation was swift, and ksɛhen was sacked. The old city, once the center of Wajahe culture and history, was destroyed, and the clan would not recover - it would instead become a pilgrimage site, a ruined, underpopulated city that housed the ʈ͡ʂɨʐɭ-oracle of the Wajahe and not much else.

Following this battle, Hisitse would conquer Ksehen, and emerge as the [3rd Dynasty](Hisitse%20Clan#Third%20Dynasty) of the Wajahe.

The **Purple Road** is a trade network that spans multiple continents. Named after the Purple dye which is the most expensive commodity traded, it actually represents a wide wealth of resources and forms the backbone of eastward and westward trade for the Wajahe - who's position on the [[Great River]], which is the richest and most urbanized section of the trade route, results in much of the wealth of this trade being concentrated among the Wajahe. 

The Purple road is largely a land-based route for its eastern section, but becomes a maritime route in its western section, with [[Ksy]] (Sishaxy) serving as the primary transition point.

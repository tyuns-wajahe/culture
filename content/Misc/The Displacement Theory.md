The **Displacement Theory** posits that a large group of unknown western peoples were conquered by the Wajahe sometime during the [[Predynastic Period]], and were resettled among the Wajahe as an enslaved class. The origins of this people is unknown, but it is believed to have heavily influenced the Wajahic language, and is noted as a cause for many differences in words between the Wajahe and the [[Imyes]] during the [Collapse of the 1st Dynasty](Ksehen%20Clan#Collapse%20of%20the%20First%20Dynasty). These people are also sometimes credited with causing the eastward migration of the [[Tanlhawes]] into their present location in the northern mountains of [[Zitis]]. Sources for this theory outside of linguistics draw from the oral traditions of the [Kih Wajahe](Tim%20Clan) and the Tanlhawes, which were recorded during the 1st Dynasty and mention these people, as a group of eastern invaders and raiders that were summarily defeated upon their first contact with the Wajahe, who were warriors far beyond their ilk.

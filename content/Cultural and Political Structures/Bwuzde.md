The **Bwuzde**, or Chief of the Skies, was the title legendarily held by [[Bemwe De]] after [[The Ksehyl]], and continued to be held by the [[Bemwe Clan]] until its decline early in the [[Predynastic Period]]. It was also used by the [[Ihwtsrksiw]] during the Late Period - however, most Wajahe do not consider this a legitimate inheritance of the title, and consider it to have faded into history long before the emergence of that state. Unlike the [[Chuzde]], there is no cultural relevance associated with the title.

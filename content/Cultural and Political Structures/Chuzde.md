The Chuzde is the historical title claimed by the chiefs of [[Ksehen Clan]], and forms a portion of the title of [[Svr]] of [[Svr-Ksehen]]. 
### Origins
The title of Chuzde claims direct descent from [[Bemwe Gehan]], the title itself being established after the [[The Ksehyl]]. It was one of the two titles used to assert control over a [[Vacant Clan]].
### The Chief of Ksehen & The First Dynasty
The Chuzde was, of course, the [[Clan Chief]] of Ksehen. This title, along with all clan chiefs, gradually lost power over time, with the Elders ruling the states in all but name, the Chief becoming a glorified executioner who also retained some religious responsibilities. This did not meaningfully change when the First Dynasty was established.
### The Chizl-Oracle
After the capture of Koshayis by the 1st Dynasty, the [[Oracle]] was moved to Koshayis. A child of the Chuzde and Oracle caused the two titles to be unified, and passed down under Wajahe succession laws, which prevented the title from falling into another lineage. The holders of this position served as major religious leaders and diplomats between the clans in confederation, until the collapse of the 1st Dynasty.
### Decline
Despite the decline of Ksehen, the title of Chizl-Oracle continued to be used. These figures practiced a form of religion that was archaic and conservative, and bore little resemblance to the true religion of Ejee contemporary to them. The Chizl-Oracle did not even rule the city of Ksehen, possessed little wealth or influence, and essentially operated a minor cult that no state took serious notice of. 
### Svr and the Wajahe lineage of Svr
*See [[Svr]]*

In [[Second Oracular War]] in 2590 KS after the sack of [Hkshit](Hkshit%20(City)), [[Svr]] 51 of Koshayis elevated the Chizl-Oracle to Svr 1 of the Wajahe Svr lineage. The Chizl-Oracle became a (theocratic) monarch of the new city of Svr, established on the site of Ksehen but populated mostly with [[Ejee]] settlers. The city was formally annexed into the [6th Dynasty](Tsepwe%20Clan#6th%20Dynasty), but the lineage remained in power of the state, a state which continued into the [[Second Intermediate Period]]. From this point onwards, the title of Chizl-Oracle is considered simply one facet of the full title of the Wajahe Svr.

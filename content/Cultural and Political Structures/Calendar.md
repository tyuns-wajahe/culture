The Wajahe have 2 parallel calendars, one Lunar and one Solar. Both are typically used to track the same things, though there are solar and lunar specific dates for festivals and similar occurrences (for example, solstices and equinoxes are measured with the Solar calendar). These calendars are region-wide, and the Wajahe tend to prefer the Lunar calendar over the Solar one (but nonetheless use both interchangeably).
## Solar Calendar

The Solar calendar has years of 428 days, which matches the solar cycle.

A Solar Year is divided into 12 months. The first 11 months have 6 weeks of 6 days each, for a total of 36 days. The 12th month has 5 weeks of 6 days each, for a total of 30 days. There are 2 yearends, one marking the start of the year and the other marking the end - these 2 days are not associated with any month.  

The Solar Year begins with the Summer Solstice, which marks the Beginning Yearend.
## Lunar Calendar

The Lunar calendar is divided on the basis of months, which match the cycle of the Greater Moon, 30 days long. A lunar month is divided into 5 Lunar Weeks, of 6 days each.

A Lunar Year consists of 14 months. However, the Lunar and Solar years are aligned, with a periodicity of 60 years. In order to facilitate this alignment, every 4 years, a 15th Month is added, and every 60 years, a 16th Month is added.
## Intersection of Calendars

The alignment of Solar and Lunar calendars is not exact. The Lunar Calendar begins roughly with the onset of winter. The Solar Calendar begins with the Summer Solstice. This has led to a deviancy of 117 days between the start of the Solar and Lunar calendars - the Beginning Yearend of Year 0 in the Solar Calendar represents Month 3 Day 27 Year 0 in the Lunar Calendar. 
  
When discussing generic terms for items like a day, week (6 days), or year (428 days), the Lunar terms are used as the default. The Solar terms are only used with specific relevance to the Solar Calendar. Note that Solar and Lunar months are of different lengths, so they do not overlap in such a way.
## Marking Dates & Years

The abbreviation KS follows the date, which is short for the [kse.hyl](The%20Ksehyl), the battle between [tæ.nwɛ t͡sɛ](Bemwe%20De.md) and [tæ.nwɛ ksæ.hɛn](Bemwe%20Gehan.md). For dates before 0 KS, the letters ZM are used.

With dates, the letter s (meaning “and”) is used to separate, in order, the day, week, month, and year. Since months have names, it is easy to infer which calendar is being used for from any full date. However, if numerals are being used instead of the Month name (which is common in informal or accounting contexts), then the calendar being used is ambiguous. In case of the yearends on the solar calendar, the name of the yearend is followed by the number of the year (once again separated by the letter s). At the very end of the date, either KS or ZM are used (though KS is typically dropped except in extremely formal writing).

Year 0 itself is marked in-script by dropping the year, and using only KS.

Many times, people will record just the year, and no other component of the date. In this case, it is ambiguous whether the solar or lunar calendar is being used.

0 KS also means 2 entirely different things in the Lunar and Solar reckoning, and there is no attempt to reconcile the ambiguity. Indeed, the battle that marks 0 KS did not occur on the first date of that year, but on 3s2s12sKS (lunar), in the summertime of the year towards its end.

## Counting time

There are 12 hours in a day and 12 in the night, 12 sectors in an hour, 12 minutes in a sector, and 12 seconds in a minute.

The **Archon** can refer to:
- The head of state of the [[Empire of Whiterun]]
- The head of state of any of the successor states to the Empire of Whiterun
- The head of state of the City of Whiterun, after it's independence from [[Hisitse Clan]] following the breaking of the [[Treaty of Eternal Peace]].
- The head of state of a Whiterun of the [12th Dynasty](Chyowo%20Clan#The%2012th%20Dynasty)

In each of these capacities, the Archon represents a form of implementation of [[Dual Power]] wherein both Civic and Military powers are separated in the state but are vested overall into the Archon, who acts separately and distinctly as the Monarch and [[Exarch]].

The Wajahe languages have used a variety of scripts, which have formed the basis of the scripts used across [[Zitis]]. There is some debate on whether or not the Wajahe invented writing, but the paper-based Wajahe scripts directly dictate the writing systems and styles used throughout the region. These scripts have evolved significantly over the 1500 years of Wajahe writing.
### The Old Wajahic Script
The Old Wajahic Script was a logography used between 1550 KS and 2100 KS. It is theorized to be related to the knot-based script used by the [[Dajitti]] peoples, as a paper adaptation of the script. This is explained by the relative meaninglessness of logographic forms, and the direct relationship to knot logographs.

### Wajahe Shorthand
The Wajahe shorthand was a shortened form of the logographic script. It remains a true logography, and in addition, there is no formulaic conversion between the Old Wajahic Script logogram and its respective shorthand form. Some characters from that script (specifically, the rebus glyphs) are listed below:

### Early Abjads
The rebus glyphs from the Shorthand script eventually devolved into a script with consonantal forms. Historically, this process began in the western regions of [Tschyowo](Chyowo%20Clan) and [Yazhay](Yerzhay%20Clan.md), between 1800 and 2000 KS. This produced a variety of regionalized scripts across the west, of which the two used in an official capacity are shown below. These scripts eventually developed two major scripts for the Wajahe - the Low Abjad and High Abjad, used across the Low and High lakelands respective. These two scripts had fully replaced the logography in use by 2100 KS. The Low Abjad eventually spread west, and the scripts of the [[Tswezets]] and [[Ejee]] are derived from it. The High Abjad similarly spread east, becoming the script of the [[Imyes]], [[Wzetsyew]], and various Cyeeho peoples further to the east. The [Riverine](The%20Riverine%20Culture) script was derived from a variety of Wajahe scripts.

An innovation of these scripts is the modifier letters. Rather than simply using rebus glyphs of consonants to write words and having the vowels be entirely inferred, a set of 3 overline glyphs (with a significant absence) are used to mark the 4 possible vowel harmonic alignments of a word. These would develop into abugida forms for the [[Siguish]] and Thunan abugidas used far to the northwest.

### Classical Wajahic Script

The Classical Wajahe Script is a derivative script from the Low Abjad which gained prominence around 2450 KS. It features somewhat curved forms and some degree of simplification, while retaining the general structure and use. Derivatives of this script include the scripts of the [[Jagefja]] and [[Tanlhawes]].

### Middle Wajahic Abjad

The Middle Abjad was the form of the script used to write all 3 Middle Wajahic varieties. It gained prominence around 2870 KS along the Great River (and it would take several decades before its widespread adoption in the Lakes). This script has 4 forms for most characters - word-initial, medial, word-final, and standalone. It also features several ligatures. This script has no widespread derivatives, though the [[Tswezets]], especially in the east, use it as well without any serious adaptation.

*In entries with 4 symbols, the first is word-initially, the second is medially, the third is word-finally, and the fourth is standalone. In entries with 3 symbols, the first is word-initially and medially, the second is word-finally, and the third is standalone. In entries with 2 symbols, the first is word-initially medially and standalone, and the second is word-finally. In entries with 1 symbol, it uses that symbol in all contexts. The third row of symbols is ligatures, where the edges can be adapted to place them within a word.*

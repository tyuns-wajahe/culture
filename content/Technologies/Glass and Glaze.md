Glass is primarily an ornamental invention, as most cooking vessels are still pottery. In fact, glass is frequently combined with pottery, for example to make a lid for an ornamental pot or decorations on an ornamental chariot, and it is uncommon for artifacts made entirely of glass to exist. Rarely, glass is blown with dyes and coloring, the most prized of this being the purple dye. Having a necklace of purple dye beads is the ultimate status symbol, and the chiefs of cities are rarely seen without this. Glass eyes are also common for people who have lost an eye in battle.

On Pottery, the Wajahe primarily use black glaze. There are 2 main styles of black glaze, the first is a plain black glaze which uses slag from iron ore processing to gain the color, the second is similar to red-figure pottery where the pot is first covered in a white / beige paint, then glazed but the glaze itself is applied in such a way that a picture emerges with a black glaze background and a white foreground.

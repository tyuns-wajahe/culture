Wajahe wool is made from 2 sources. The first, and primary source, is the wool of goats, bred specifically for this. This wool is carded with a special comb and spun into a yarn, which is then weaved for clothing, blankets, and other purposes. The second source is the wooly saiga. The hairs of this animal are a lot thinner, and therefore carding with a comb would damage the wool. Instead, it is carded by hand in a tedious and time intensive process, and then spun into a much finer string rather than a thick yarn. The overall result is a much thinner and lighter cloth that nonetheless provides the warmth of wool. Goat wool cloth, which is much easier to produce, is also a lot less expensive, and is a key component of winter clothing, replacing the linens and leathers of the summer. Saiga wool is instead a status symbol, worn primarily in ceremonial garments. It is a rare sight outside of the cities, and even within the cities is considered an heirloom and passed down. This is both due to the intensive process but also the relative rarity of the wooly saiga, who favor the open plains of the north and east to the lakeside.

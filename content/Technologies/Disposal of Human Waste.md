The lakes and rivers serve as an important lifeline for the Wajahe civilization. Running water cannot be disrupted or tainted with filth, and people should not drink this tainted water - fines are placed upon one who urinates or defecates into running water that is not specifically designated for such a purpose (as is common in the south-east, where the prevalence of wetlands somewhat mitigates this issue). Likewise, progression in the alchemical beliefs spurred by the slow rediscovery of [Riverine](The%20Riverine%20Culture) manuscripts has created the need for the exotic form of urine-bleaching, and that the remains of animal and human waste can increase the virility of the soil, after being appropriately treated to avoid increased attraction of pests. The Wajahe have developed a public system, through the employment and creation of public restrooms in city centers, which will collect Urine to be bought by Industries at a subsidized rate, primarily fiber-workers and dyers, who benefit from the hastened and successful form of bleaching. This system is based heavily on that of the city of [[Koshayis]], the progenitor of this innovation.

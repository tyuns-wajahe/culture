The **Bemwe** Clan was the original clan of [[Bemwe De]]. During the early predynastic period, alongside the [[Ksehen Clan]] it held the chiefdoms of many other clans in [Vacancy](Vacant%20Clan). It never sedenterized, leading to a slow decline of the clan as settled agriculture became the norm. The eventual fate of the clan is unknown, but since the days of earliest writing, no people alive have attempted to claim descent from the Bemwe Clan (many [Kih Wajahe](Tim%20Clan) claimed descent from Bemwe De, but not from the clan - rather, from the period in which the Tim Clan was held vacant).

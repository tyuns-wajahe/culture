##### The Younger Gods
The Younger Gods are humans blessed with divinity by Aiokkais. This is a blessing granted upon death to those who are truly extraordinary in their lives, typically exclusively for a great warrior, strategist, or general. Some of these gods were elevated when Aiokkais was first choosing chiefs to fight against Osaeuais, and some were elevated much later (some, like [[Kzletse]], are attested significantly in the written historical record).

### Notes on Gods and Divinity
- Gods, like people, do not have a Gender (and additionally lack all secondary sexual characteristics). All are equal between the steppe and the dark sky.

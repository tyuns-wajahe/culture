### The Pantheon
##### The Eldest
- [[Osaeuais]] - the Eternal Darkness of the night sky and open sea
##### The Elder Gods
The Elder Gods are the kin of Aiokkais.
- [[Aiokkais]]: Sun god, Supreme god

##### The Younger Gods
The Younger Gods are humans blessed with divinity by Aiokkais. This is a blessing granted upon death to those who are truly extraordinary in their lives, typically exclusively for a great warrior, strategist, or general. Some of these gods were elevated when Aiokkais was first choosing chiefs to fight against Osaeuais, and some were elevated much later (some, like [[Kzletse]], are attested significantly in the written historical record).

- [bɛmɰɛ dɛ](Bemwe De): God of the [[Jagefja]] Steppe, legendary chieftain of the Wajahe. Many early descendants are also gods.

### Notes on Gods and Divinity
- Gods, like people, do not have a Gender (and additionally lack all secondary sexual characteristics). All are equal between the steppe and the dark sky.
- While less important gods are often depicted using imagery or icons, more important gods (Aiokkais, his children, and Bemwe De and Bemwe Gehan) are never depicted with iconography but rather with writing. They often have unique ligatures that act as symbols for the deity, and are used in place of a physical humanoid depiction in artwork. Osaeuais is also not depicted with a humanoid form, but instead always as a large and abstract mass of darkness.

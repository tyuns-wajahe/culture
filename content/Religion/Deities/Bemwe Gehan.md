**Bemwe Gehan** is a deity and legendary Chief of the Wajahe, who was defeated by [[Bemwe De]] during the [[The Ksehyl]]. He is the god and patron deity of the Lake Wajahe, which makes him an extremely significant deity to most Wajahe. The [[Ksehen Clan]], which dominated most of early Wajahe history, consider themselves to be the clan Bemwe Gehan was originally from. His title, the [[Chuzde]], has remained important throughout Wajahe history - first as a leader of several [[Vacant Clan]]s, later as an important legal office within the [1st Dynasty](Ksehen%20Clan#The%20First%20Dynasty) with a unique position to guide affairs, and then during the [6th Dynasty](Tsepwe%20Clan#6th%20Dynasty) as the head of state of [Svr](Svr-Ksehen) and the leader of the Wajahe section of the [[Ejee]] religion coequal with the [[Oracle]] of Koshayis. As such, Wajahe from all walks of life venerate Bemwe Gehan in some capacity of his person (godhood) or his title.

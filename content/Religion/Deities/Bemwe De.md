**Bemwe De** is a deity and legendary Chief of the Wajahe, who defeated [[Bemwe Gehan]] during the [[The Ksehyl]]. He is the god and patron deity of the Steppe Wajahe, a tradition currently followed by the few surviving bands of [[Imyes]]. His title, the [[Bwuzde]], fell out of use with the decline of the [[Bemwe Clan]], early in the [[Predynastic Period]], but was temporarily used by the [[Ihwtsrksiw]] during the Late Period of that state.

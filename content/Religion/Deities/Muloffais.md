**Muloffais** is a son of [[Aiokkais]] and the god of winds and storms. Muloffais is quick to anger, and will bring the wrath of all his powers down upon man at the slightest provocation. In this, he is the opposite of [[Eafais]]; but the two share a strong bond, and are much closer with each other than they are with the eldest child, [[Iflaukais]].

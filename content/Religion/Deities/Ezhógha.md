**Ezhógha** is a creator deity of [[The Riverine Culture]], who's corruption and fall into tyranny was one of the major mythological tales of that civilization. He shackled the sun and the greater moon, his parents, to the world he created, to easily populate it with life. He was laid to eternal rest by [[Sagéla]] where he sleeps beneath the [[Great River]], but will eventually awaken again and destroy the world in revenge.

Ezhógha is considered to arise from the same root deity as the Wajahe deity [[Aiokkais]] - the two share many similarities, and the corruption of Ezhógha was similar in its conception to [[The Argument in the Skies]] - though cultural differences led to very different positions and characterizations of these gods. Ezhógha is also the root god from which the deity [[Ezzhé]], worshipped in the [[Whiterun Clan]], originates.

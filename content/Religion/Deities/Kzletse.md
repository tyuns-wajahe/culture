**Kzletse** is a deity and a folk hero in Wajahe mythology, famous for his innovations in the fields of mathematics and civil engineering. He is the patron god of Engineers and of [the City of Whiterun](Tsynzkyy.md). After the defeat of his home, [[Whiterun Clan]], in [[The Custard Wars]], he organized a project to level the hill on which the decisive battle of that conflict was fought. His notes during this project, and the areas of mathematics and engineering that he had to invent to enable it, became the foundational text of much of early Wajahe Engineering. He is one of the few individuals commonly held to be elevated to Godhood by [[Aiokkais]] without being a warrior.

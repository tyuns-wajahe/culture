**Aiokkais** is the first God, the supreme god, the sun god, and the father of [[Eafais]], [[Muloffais]], and [[Iflaukais]]. In the earliest days following the creation of life, he engaged in a war with the eternal darkness [[Osaeuais]], taking on his aspect as a Sun god and driving back the darkness, then and periodically as time goes on. He is the god of warriors, of chiefs, and of tyrants, and himself ruled over the other gods as a tyrant, until, after [[The Argument in the Skies]], he deemed them unworthy of his attentions. His nature - that of a tyrannical but loving, righteous but merciful, fiery but amenable - make him a model that every Wajahe strives to emulate. As the greatest warrior and strategist, he is worshipped primarily by members of the military, for whom he is the patron god.

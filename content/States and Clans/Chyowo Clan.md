The **Yerzhay** or Yazhay clan is a clan of the Lake Wajahe, established from the territory of the [[Nla Clan]] sometime during the [1st Dynastic Period](Ksehen%20Clan#The%20First%20Dynasty) and emerging alongside it's [titular Capital city](Yerzhay%20(City).md). It is best known for being the center of three Wajahe dynastic states: The [[4th Dynasty]], WIP Dynasty, and the 12th Dynasty.

### The 4th Dynasty
*See [[4th Dynasty]]*
Chyowo was the core of the 4th Dynastic state after [[The Tsyw War]] pushed the state, originally established by the [[Yerzhay Clan]], out of their original center of power. The state continued to survive here until its conquest by the [3rd Dynasty](Hisitse%20Clan#Third%20Dynasty) during the [[Kapapt Wars]].\

### Wip Dynasty

### The 12th Dynasty
The 12th Dynasty, also known as the Imperial State of All Peoples of the River, or as the Confederal State of the Council of All Whiteruns, was a major empire of the Wajahe centered originally on Chyowo.

##### 5th Dynasty
The 5th Dynasty of the Wajahe was a major Wajahe state centered on the city of [Whiterun](Tsynzkyy.md). Emerged after the collapse of the [2nd Dynasty](Tsepwe%20Clan#2nd%20Dynasty) in 2235 KS, during [[The Tsyw War]]. It conquered east, into some territory of the [[Imyes]], and was able to outlast the [3rd Dynasty](Hisitse%20Clan#Third%20Dynasty) during the [[The Imyes Plague]]. It would collapse during the [Third Hisitse Civil War](The%20Hisitse%20Civil%20Wars) in 2553 KS, after its conquest by [[Tsepwe Clan]]. During this period, it would continue the legacy of the [2nd Dynasty](Tsepwe%20Clan#2nd%20Dynasty), as a center for mathematics and engineering. In addition, the religion of Whiterun would begin to diverge from the mainline Wajahe religion during this period, influenced heavily by the [[Ihwtsrksiw]] and [[The Riverine Culture]].

The Tim, later known as the Kih, were an ancient clan of the Wajahe. They are best known for their conquest of the [[Zuu6]] (katniket…õ) people. At an unknown point before 400 KS, they split in two, with the Eastern half largely having a Zuu6 character, assimilating many conquered individuals from that group, while the Western half was known for their metalwork. 

They would eventually become a [[Vacant Clan]] sometime around 650 KS, ruled by a resurgent [[Chuzde]]. They would soon after be defeated by [Ksehen](Ksehen%20Clan) in a series of wars, and rather than accept subjugation, one group fled to the northeast (while the other, smaller group, joined the confederation with Ksehen and [Nla](Nla%20Clan)). Here, they would establish a single city (of unknown name), but otherwise return to a semi-nomadic lifestyle in the steppe. It is known that they spoke their own variety of Wajahic, sufficiently distinct from the 1st Dynasty dialect to be unintelligible, but this language was never written down and no records in it remain.

*The Tim Clan (light blue) before their defeat by Ksehen, sometime around 1290 KS. Their defeat would also finialize the cultural collapse of the remnants of the Zuu6 people.*

Around 1880 KS, they entered a state of decline. Remnants of their civilization would eventually be taken over by the [[Imyes]] after their defeat by [Tsepwe](Tsepwe%20Clan) and [Hisitse](Hisitse%20Clan) drove them into the steppe - the Imyes had assimilated into the Lake Wajahe culture and language which fully replaced the Tim culture, which ceased to exist thereafter in any meaningful form (approximately 2065 KS).

### Third Dynasty
The Third Dynastic state emerged during the early years of the [[First Intermediate Period]], after Hisitse's defeat over [[Ksehen Clan]] during the [[Sack of Ksehen (2232 KS)]]. During this period, it defeated both the [2nd Dynasty](Tsepwe%20Clan#2nd%20Dynasty) and [[4th Dynasty]], and the [[Kapapt]] of the [[Great River]] in the [[Kapapt Wars]]. It would facilitate the emergence of the [5th Dynasty](Whiterun%20Clan#5th%20Dynasty), with whom it would remain a strong ally. It would collapse during [[The Imyes Plague]], during which 20% of its population would perish, the [[Yerzhay Clan]], [[Chyowo Clan]], and [[Tsepwe Clan]] would rebel for their independence, and Hisitse would enter a [period of internal conflict](The%20Hisitse%20Civil%20Wars).

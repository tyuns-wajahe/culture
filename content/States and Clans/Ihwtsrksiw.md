The **Ihwtsrksiw** was a large state of the [[Imyes]] established soon after the [[The Imyes Plague]], in 2490 KS, and collapsing in 2783 KS.

### Establishment
The Ihwtsrksiw was established as a confederation between the 4 clans of the [hʷɔʂhʷuɥ](Imyes). It began its rise to power (having experienced and therefore recovered from the plague sooner than the Wajahe), and attempted to conquer territory from the somewhat weakened [5th Dynasty](Whiterun%20Clan#5th%20Dynasty). A battle was set to take place on a strategically chosen hill, however an unexpected and violent rainstorm scattered both sides, and the battle on the following day was located on a site favorable to 5th Dynasty who handily defeated the aggressors and pushed forward to conquer some additional territory themselves. However, the end result of this conflict was to rally the clans of the hʷɔʂhʷuɥ who remained in their confederation as a direct result of this war, even despite their defeat during it.

### Early Period
The early period followed the establishment, and can be roughly dated to between 2500 and 2600 KS. The Ihwtsrksiw would expand northwards into the [[Jagefja]] and [[Tanlhawes]] during this period.

This period is particularly interesting because it represents a broader cultural extension of the Wajahic stratocratic state. The eastern Wajahe, the reorganized remnants of the Imyes migration and the old [Kih clan](Tim%20Clan), together the [hʷɔʂhʷuɥ](Imyes) but calling themselves the ɨɡwɨʈʂ, had a period of significant consolidation, leading to the emergence of the state of ihʷwt͡sr̩ksiw. As noted above, it was even strong and organized enough to engage in conflict with hʷwɨɥtr̩n, though it was defeated in the seminal battle of that conflict. This state is somewhat different from the ones to the west, as the [chief](Clan%20Chief) retains significant power. This is assumed to derive from the chiefs of the old Kih clan, who claimed direct descent from [tɛŋʷwe t͡se](Bemwe%20De), and upheld his legacy of a stratocratic administration led by a strong chief who remained in ownership of livestock and slaves.

*The end of the Early Period. Note the [Wajahe 6th Dynasty](Tsepwe%20Clan#6th%20Dynasty) that has emerged to the west*

### Late Period
The late period would be characterized by nearly 2 centuries of rapid and unconstrained expansion, which would directly lead to their collapse. As the state was extremely decentralized during most of this period, essentially no writing is preserved from the state.
### Collapse
The Ihwtsrksiw would eventually collapse as a result of a significantly overextended apparatus that was not able to respond to regional rebellions. This would be followed by a major cultural collapse of the [[Imyes]] and their replacement by the [[Jagefja]] and [[Wzetsyew]].

The **Bepatj** was a large but shortlived [Riverine](The%20Riverine%20Culture) confederation, comprising of much of the land in the Lower section of the [[Great River]]. It was founded by the various Riverine splinter states of the [1st Dynasty](Ksehen%20Clan#The%20First%20Dynasty), through a slow process of consolidation and unification. It was an empire that greatly prioritized learning and education, and founded numerous [[Great Libraries]] across its territory.

It would engage against the [[Oraculate]] in the [[First Oracular War]], which it would lose handily, and with it, lose [[Sishaxy]]. These conquests would trigger the [[Second Oracular War]] and its follow-up, the [[Third Oracular War]], in which the Bepatj and the [Wajahe 6th Dynasty](Tsepwe%20Clan#6th%20Dynasty) would work together to defeat the [[Oraculate]], from which the Bepatj took significant conquests. However, the Bepatj was significantly weakened by these conflicts, and would soon be conquered by the 6th dynasty in turn - its conquests into the [[Ejee]] would not last for 2 decades. The collapse and subjugation of the Bepatj would result in the [[Decline of the Riverine Civilization]].

The Bepatj was a major state but lasted, in total, less than one century - from its formation in 2541 to its collapse in 2637. It demonstrated, in clear terms, the inability of the Rivermen to field militaries that matched the rapidly modernizing states surrounding them; and additionally, was an early symptom of cultural decline.

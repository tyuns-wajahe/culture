The Nla were an ancient clan of the Wajahe, in the north-westernmost area of the Lakes. One of the earliest clans to centralize and consolidate, and also a relative leader in sedenterization due to extended cultural contact with [[The Riverine Culture]], they would join [Ksehen](Ksehen%20Clan) in attacking the settlements of the Lower River. They would become rich off of tribute payments from the Riverine cities, controlling a major bottleneck of regional trade, eventually subjugating even [[Sishaxy]]. They would establish the 1st Dynasty along with Ksehen, in which (at the time of establishment) they were arguably the stronger and wealthier component state. However, sometime during the 1st Dynasty, a new clan in the area, [Chyowo](Chyowo%20Clan) would arise, driven by the success of their city of the same name. Thereafter, the Nla would fade into obscurity, and the clan is dated to officially end and be merged into the Chyowo with the execution of their chief by the [[Imyes]] during the collapse of the 1st Dynasty.

A branch of the Nla conquered the western tributary of the [[Great River]]. There, they would become local rulers, and assimilate into the Riverine population they conquered. After being defeated in successive wars by the city state of [[Sishaxy]], the main Nla clan, and the [[Tswezets]], they were displaced far north. Crossing the high mountains (being spurred further north by conflict with the [[Sprunnish]]), this group would become the progenitor for the Nwah peoples of the far north, who's civilization would outlast their Riverine cousins [after their decline and collapse](Decline%20of%20the%20Riverine%20Civilization).

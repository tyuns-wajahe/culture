The **4th Dynasty** was a state of the Wajahe founded with the defeat of [[Chyowo Clan]] by the [[Yerzhay Clan]]. It would very quickly become a cooperative confederation between both clans, and might possibly represent the only single period in world history when the Chyowo and Yerzhay did not feud over every little thing constantly and hate each others guts. It would eventually be pushed fully into Chyowo land by [[Hisitse Clan]], and after the [[Kapapt Wars]], would be conquered entirely by the [3rd Dynasty](Hisitse%20Clan#Third%20Dynasty).

**Ksy**, alternatively Sishaxy, is the port city on the mouth of the [[Great River]]. It has always maintained a unique and diverse characteristic, and supports populations from the [[Tswezets]], Wajahe, [[Ejee]], and formerly the [Rivermen](The%20Riverine%20Culture). The city itself is controlled by ever-changing mercantile factions, that have always managed to maintain autonomy when ruled by foreign powers by paying administrators to ignore their activities. Since the city is the primary maritime export point for the [[Purple Road]], it retains a high degree of wealth and an unusual degree of social mobility for a city in [[Zitis]]. However, these same factors make it a poorly suited center for expansion and conquest, and Sishaxy has, for most of its existence, been subjugated by Riverine, Ejee, Wajahe, or Tswezets empires.

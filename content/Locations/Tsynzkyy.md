**Tsynzkyy**, formally **kzɛ t͡sỹz.kyɥ wɨɥ.tr̩.mẽ** \[the Stone City of Whiterun\], formerly known simply as wɨɥ.tr̩m, is a settlement of the Wajahe that serves as the center of the [[Whiterun Clan]] and of the Whiterun of Whiterun, established sometime during the [[Predynastic Period]]. Its position on the frontiers of the Lake Wajahe have resulted in Whiterun having a local culture and identity somewhat different than the rest of the Wajahe, with some notable differences including the god [[Ezzhé]], their practice of burials for the dead, and the institution of [[Shadow Feng Shui]]. Throughout its history, its position on the frontier has lent it an outsized influence on [[Zitis]] politics and culture, something best seen with the [[Empire of Whiterun]] and its many successor states across the [[Jagefja]], [[Wzetsyew]], and [[Tanlhawes]].

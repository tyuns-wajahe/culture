Kheze was the first city of the [Wajahe](index.md), founded in 1028 KS. The name of the city itself means "the place where oats are stored". It was a center of trade across the lakes, and had strong trading ties to the various [Riverine](The%20Riverine%20Culture.md) cities to the south. It was also famous for being the first known walled city in the world, though these were a simple wooden palisade. For most of its history, however, Kheze was overshadowed by its neighbor, [Hisitse](Hisitse%20(City)). It never established a true city-state of its own (that extended significantly beyond its immediate walls), instead serving as an early capital of the [[Ksehen Clan]], prior to the establishment of [the titular city](Svr-Ksehen.md).

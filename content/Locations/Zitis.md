### Cultures of Zitis

Zitis is relatively culturally homogenous (populated by a group of related cultures with a long history of intermixing), but very linguistically diverse. The northwestern and northeastern edges are populated by two branches of Efic peoples - the [[Wzetsyew]] and [[Tswezets]]. The northern mountains are the home of the [[Tanlhawes]], the most distinct culture of the region, that also speaks a language isolate. The foothills just to the south of the Tanlhawes are populated by the [[Jagefja]], a culture group that is considered (and considers themselves) Wajahe, but speak an Efic language. Far to the south are the [[Ejee]], a maritime culture with colonies across the Western Sea. And in the center are the [Proper Wajahe](Cultural%20Divisions,%20Structures,%20Lives,%20and%20Livelihoods.md#t͡sæ̃hʷ.kn̩l%20-%20The%20Wajahe%20of%20the%20Lakes), across the fertile lake shores and the [[Great River]].

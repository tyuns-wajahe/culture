**Vtetwe** is a city of the [[Tanlhawes]], established by the [3rd Dynasty](Hisitse%20Clan#Third%20Dynasty) of the Wajahe in 2462 KS. The 3rd Dynasty conquered this land, and resettled Tanlhawes people from the area around it to establish a city, in order to more easily administer their conquests. This city remains an important urban center for the Tanlhawes people.
### Establishment
Vtetwe was established in 2462 KS. The 3rd Dynasty had conquered this section of the Tanlhawes people. Legend goes that the Tanlhawes people requested the creation of a city, which spurred the Wajahe invasion in the first place, as well as the foundation of this city. However, this is largely believed to be propaganda carried out by Hisitse, who had conquered this land as it was an important bottleneck in the precious metals trade.

The city itself was established with a Wajahe elite, and followed Wajahe cultural and architectural styles. While the control over the city would be lost during [[The Hisitse Civil Wars]], after which it would become an independent state of the Tanlhawes, it retained its Wajahic character far into the future. Though there was a major rebellion during the height of [[The Imyes Plague]], leading to a second generation of clan leaders that had either assimilated into the [ŋihsiɥ](Tanlhawes) or rose to power during the rebellion - this second generation still upheld the Wajahic structure of the stratocratic state, and continued to hold land and livestock in the Wajahe manner rather than their traditional one. This city also retained its literacy, with their own adaptation of the [abjad](Wajahic%20Scripts.md) to their tongue, enabling easy communication with the rest of the Wajahe world.

### Sixth Dynastic Period
During the [Sixth Dynastic Period](Tsepwe%20Clan#6th%20Dynasty), the city would be a site of a large northern state, for which it represented the urban center. It would lose most of its Wajahic character during this time, with the Wajahic elites and the use of the Wajahe language long since gone.

### Second Intermediate Period
During the [[Second Intermediate Period]], the city would be a frequent site of conflict between the [[Empire of Whiterun]] (and its successor polities), and various Tanlhawes states.

Several notable settlements exist within [[Jağefj]] territory.

#### Ofjonbof/Dwāššgwes
Originally an [[Tswezets|Efelöhian]] citadel known as Ufiannpaf ('tall hill'), this citadel serves as the center of Jağefj culture, and for some centuries was the capitol of the first native Jağefj polity, the [[State of Ofjonbof]]. As part of the Great Reforms in 3011, the city was renamed Dwāššgwes, a common nickname of the city originally meaning 'House of [[Jağefj Religion|Šaš]],' in part to emphasize the (supposed) piety of its rulers, in part to move away from a name that, due to centuries of shifts in meaning, now meant something like 'big pile.'
#### Urolonguğ
Urolonguğ, literally 'bridge city,' is a city in the north-western part of Efj. It was established as a city around 2650 KS, around the same time as it came under the control of the Vutétwénh Protectorate, the major T’anlhawes state of the era. It would remain under their control for over 300 years, only becoming part of the State of Ofjonbof in the late 30th century KS, after the collapse of the Protectorate.
#### Pešingve
Originally an Igiichi citadel called pɛʈʂiŋβɛ, the settlement came under Jağefj rule in the late 28th century KS during the early phase of their settlement of the Eastern Steppe.

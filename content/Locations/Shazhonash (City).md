**Shazhonash** or ʂɐ.ʐo.nɐʂ is a city along the [[Great River]], established by [[The Riverine Culture]]. A major confederal partner of the [1st Dynasty](Ksehen%20Clan#The%20First%20Dynasty), its position on the confluence of rivers gave it economic and strategic value. It would form a local state, that would be later incorporated into the [[Bepatj]]. It remains a significant city even after the [[Decline of the Riverine Civilization]] and Wajahic settlement, and is the center of [[Shazhonash Clan]].

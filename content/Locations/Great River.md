The **Great River**, known variously as Ifesa, yisa, and nun, is the largest river in [[Zitis]] and serves as a center for commerce, transportation, and religion in the region. Once populated by the [Riverine Civilization](The%20Riverine%20Culture), their [decline](Decline%20of%20the%20Riverine%20Civilization.md) led to Wajahe settlement over the Lower and Middle sections of the river, and Efic settlement over the Upper section. 

### Sections

The Great River is divided into 3 sections, corresponding to subdivisions within [[The Riverine Culture]], subdivisions that remain relevant between the cultures currently residing along its banks. As the course of the river is East to West, the sections are named appropriately.

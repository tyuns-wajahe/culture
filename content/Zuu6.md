The Zuu6 are an ancient Cyeeho people that are considered the ancestors of the [[Dajitti]]. They once inhabited the land to the south-east of the Wajahe. They were a fully nomadic civilization, and renowned horse herders, with their own breed of horses brought from the far east. They were largely taught horse and chariot warfare by the Wajahe, after which they began to repeatedly raid the [Wajahe](index) and [[The Riverine Culture]].

Their decline came with the conquest of much of their land by the [[Tim Clan]] of the Wajahe. After this, their movement into [[Ejee]] land and reemergence as the [[Dajitti]] is known only from oral legends, with a very limited archaeological record tracking their movement.

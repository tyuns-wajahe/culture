Svr is the name (and title) granted to all [Oracles](Oracle) of [[Koshayis]] and later of [the city of Svr](Svr-Ksehen) (which was named after the Oracle, Svr 51). Since Svr 51, the Wajahic Svr is always an oracle who rules the city of Svr. Svr is always female, following the [[Ejee]] conceptions of gender, and the title inherits choosing the second female child of the current Svr - until that lineage ends and another is chosen for the title.

### Koshayis Lineages

###### The [Chizl-Oracle](Chuzde)
With the conquest of Koshayis by the [1st Dynasty](Ksehen%20Clan), the Oracle of Koshayis was moved to Ksehen. This oracle was taken as a consort by the Chizl, and the union bore fruit, uniting the two titles. This title was inherited in the Wajahic fashion rather than the Koshyais ruling, so at some point of time, Svr and the Chizl-Oracle separated as titles; the latter remained as a lineage in Ksehen even after the collapse of the 1st Dynasty and the decline of Ksehen as a city.
###### Svr 51
Svr 51 was the ruler of the [[Oraculate]], an empire centered on Koshayis, and a natural tactician. After the conquest of the city of [Ksehen](Svr-Ksehen) in the [[Second Oracular War]], Svr moved the capital of that state to the conquered city of Ksehen (after the sacking of [Hkshit](Hkshit%20(City).md)), which was renamed to Svr. He remained oracle of Koshayis and established a Wajahic lineage of Oracles, starting with Svr 1 - an individual who served as the Ksehen Oracle, a post retained by the lineage of the old Chizl-Oracles of Ksehen. He was captured alive during the [[Third Oracular War]] and buried alive in 2592 KS.

### Wajahe Lineage

**Svr 1**
Svr 1 was elevated from the Chizl-Oracle of Ksehen in 2590 KS. Though the city was captured and formally integrated into the broader Wajahe state in 2596 KS, the Oracle retained a high degree of autonomy, which was a state of affairs that continued for his lineage; who typically remained in full control of the city of Svr and its environs. Svr 1 established the practice of speaking Ejee instead of a Wajahic language, which would become common practice across the city of Svr.

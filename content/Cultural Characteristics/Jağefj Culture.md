## Gender
The [[Jağefj]] gender system is more similar to that of the T’anlhawes to the north than of the Wajahe to the south, principally in that gender exists. Jağefj society contains two genders - braztsēb (singular brazts) and tevdzēb (tevdz); these will be translated somewhat loosely as men and women, respectively. Gender is not connected to sex, and is chosen by an individual at puberty; preadolescent children are not considered to have a gender.

Women are usually treated as intelligent, natural leaders, though not suited for manual labor. In the military, they often serve as generals. Men, in contrast, are considered to be strong workers but overly-emotional. In the military, they usually serve as infantry. Women are associated with the Greater Moon, men with the Sun, and children with the Lesser Moon.

An individual may change their gender from man to woman or woman to man, though the latter is more common.

## Family
Jağefj families, on the other hand, are structured more similarly to Wajahe families. There is a delineation between romantic and sexual partners. People may take multiple spouses, but any individual marriage must be between a man and a woman; fitting this requirement is a major motivation for changing genders. Children are raised in the home of their birth-parent (pfle). 

A Jağefj child will have many parents beyond their birth-parent, consisting of their birth-parent's husbands, if the birth-parent is a woman, or wives, if the birth-parent is a man. Parents are prohibited from entering into romantic or sexual relationships with any of their children.

Siblings are classified into two categories: close-siblings are those who were raised together; they almost always share a birth-parent. The more general class of siblings are those who are the children of the reference figure's parents. Close-siblings are prohibited from entering into romantic or sexual relations with each other; siblings are only prohibited from entering into sexual relations with each other.

## Local Government
Taking after the T’anlhawes mode of social organization, Jağefj settlements of any appreciable size are ruled by a married couple, with different roles in the management of the settlement. The tevdz ruler, the ladzngēns, will be in charge of what might be called 'big-picture' matters - she is in charge of diplomacy, is the settlement's judge, approves new civic constructions and serves as general of the settlement's forces as needed. The brazts ruler, the ladzngēj, is in charge of more day-to-day activities, ensuring that all things are proceeding 'according to plan,' performing many of the more common rituals, and is in charge of punishments and executions. As a notable consequence, most people's interactions with the machinery of government, good or ill, go through the ladzngēj.

The position of ladzngēns is hereditary, passing from mother to eldest daughter. A ladzngēns must necessarily be married, and should the eldest daughter not be married, a different tevdz relative will be found.

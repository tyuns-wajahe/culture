The **Tsyw War** was a conflict between the [3rd Dynasty](Hisitse%20Clan#Third%20Dynasty) against the [2nd Dynasty](Tsepwe%20Clan#2nd%20Dynasty) and [[4th Dynasty]], and would end with a significant victory for the 3rd Dynasty, and the establishment of the [5th Dynasty](Whiterun%20Clan#5th%20Dynasty) in Whiterun.

The conflict began when hisit͡se struck out at tsɛpʷwɛ in a border raid, crossing the lake and advancing. However, ɥəʐəɥ had heard of this planned raid, and decided this was the moment to attack hisit͡se and capture the central lakes. The armies of hisit͡se and tsɛpʷwɛ met near a stream, but by coincidence, the army of ɥəʐəɥ was nearby and rushed forward. hisit͡se crushed tsɛpʷwɛ, but realized a much larger enemy force was behind them, and just in time, turned around to engage ɥəʐəɥ, who they defeated in a close fight. After the conquest of the city of tsɛpʷwɛ, hisit͡se moved west to engage the larger threat. They defeated ɥəʐəɥ, forcing the Second Dynasty administration west to ʈ͡ʂʷɥɔwɔ, and the hisit͡se forces did not push on for fear of being overextended.

Meanwhile, hʷwɨɥtrən took a break from [leveling the hill](Kzletse) to strike for their own freedom, including the capture of some frontier territories of hisit͡se - this established the Fifth Dynasty. This state would remain a strong ally of the 3rd Dynasty, and would later fight alongside them in the [[Kapapt Wars]].

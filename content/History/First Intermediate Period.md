The **First Intermediate Period**, between 2181 KS and 2592 KS, was the period of Wajahe history between the [First](Ksehen%20Clan#The%20First%20Dynasty) and [Sixth](Tsepwe%20Clan#6th%20Dynasty) Dynasties. Beginning with the defeat of the [[Imyes]] and liberation of [Whiterun](Whiterun%20(City)), it would establish the 6-clan division of the Wajahe that would be retained in some form or another until the [Twelfth Dynasty](Chyowo%20Clan#The%20Twelfth%20Dynasty) (though with a temporary shift from the [[Ksehen Clan]] to the [[Hkshit Clan]]).

*Zitis at the start of the First Intermediate Period, around 2200 KS. There are two major Wajahic peoples - the Hry of the Lakes (divided across 6 clans) and the Imyes (who's empire has collapsed, and who are centered at the old center of the [Kih](Tim%20Clan), who they absorbed). The Riverine and Ejee civilizations would be largely free of Wajahe dominance during this period.*

The First Intermediate Period would see a major shift in the cultural character of northern [[Zitis]]. The [[Tanlhawes]] peoples would emerge from the mountains and push the [[Tswezets]] west. The Imyes would establish a large decentralized confederation, the Ihwtsrksiw, over their land and that of the [[Wzetsyew]], in imitation of the First Dynasty, which would eventually collapse and splinter. A small mixed group of Tanlhawes and Tswezets would come under Wajahe dominance towards the end of the period, and emerge as the [[Jagefja]] Wajahe, who would begin to migrate into and displace the Imyes (a process that would continue into the 6th Dynasty period). Finally, [[The Riverine Culture]] would diverge across the Lower, Middle, and Upper divisions, and the increasing lack of cultural and economic cohesion across the [[Great River]] is typically understood as the beginning of the [[Decline of the Riverine Civilization]].

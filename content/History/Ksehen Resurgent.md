During this period, the [t͡sizɮɛ](Chuzde) of [kʂɛwenʷ](Ksehen%20Clan), who was still at this point the effective ruler of the clan, began a period of major resurgence for the clan. Around the year 680, the chiefs of the nʷikʂimʷ and [k͡ximʷ](Tim%20Clan) were deposed after a battle, and they were both made into a [[Vacant Clan]]. The t͡sizɮɛ exercised his powers as [[Clan Chief]] of all 3 clans, but did not hold too significant of sway over the two recent conquests. 

By this point, the [[Bwuzde]] was a title held by and passed between minor warlords. Not until the time of the [[Imyes]] would it be of any relevance, historically or culturally. Indeed, the word itself was mostly lost, with etymologists pointing to its evolution into the word for [[Chariot]]. Meanwhile, the title of [t͡sizɮɛ](Chuzde) was hereafter of immense cultural relevance, a state which would continue until the collapse of the 1st dynasty, nearly 1800 years later.

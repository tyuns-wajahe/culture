The **Custard Wars** was a conflict between [[Tsepwe Clan]] and [[Whiterun Clan]] fought in 2217KS, and serve as an important moment in Whiterun history.

The Custard Wars began when the chief of tsɛpʷwɛ was invited to [hʷwɨɥtrən](Tsynzkyy.md) for a feast, where upon having custard, he died. Everyone assumed he was poisoned, though later historians theorize that he was just deathly allergic to eggs and did not realize custard contains eggs. This would, of course, be seen as a major provocation, and lead to war.

The battle between hʷwɨɥtrən and tsɛpʷwɛ was fought on the only hill in hʷwɨɥtrən territory (the clan being well known for their large and entirely flat pastures). The hʷwɨɥtrən chariots, deployed on the lowlands, were quickly routed by the tsɛpʷwɛ cavalry, who moved to disrupt the assault on their infantry by the enemy cavalry and were able to drive off the hʷwɨɥtrən army. This was followed by a surrender, after which hʷwɨɥtrən was made into a vassal of tsɛpʷwɛ. A tribute was enforced after this conquest, largely of soldiers. After this point, the tsɛpʷwɛ clan is considered to entire the [Second Dynastic Period]()

The hill upon which the battle was fought became a hated, evil area in the mythology of hʷwɨɥtrən. One particular warrior, [kzlet͡sɛ](Kzletse), who had fought in this battle as a teenager grew to hate this hill with a burning passion, and made it his life’s work to completely level this hill. He was an intelligent, if insane, mathematician with a classical Wajahe education in engineering, so instead of hiring laborers to take decades, he spent many years figuring out the easiest way to dismantle the hill with carts, ramps, troughs, roads, and other constructions. This was all written down in a wide array of notebooks - upon the success of his work, kzlet͡sɛ’s notes were spread with glee across the Wajahe world, and became the foundational text in Wajahe civil engineering - almost every aspect of engineering and urban planning, from walls to canals to road networks, were used somewhere in his dismantling of the mountain. A true genius but nonetheless never able to afford as many laborers as he wanted, kzlet͡sɛ would complete this endeavor in 27 years, to the utter incredulity of everyone who doubted this insane task would ever even get off the ground. His texts would also become foundational in the principles of [[Shadow Feng Shui]]. In the Wajahe religion, especially in Whiterun, it is commonly held that he ascended to Godhood upon his death, becoming the patron god of Whiterun and of Engineers and Engineering.

The **Law Code of the Clan of Whiterun**, written in 3087 KS, is present in full below. This code applies to the lands of the [[Whiterun Clan]], including the [Stone City of Whiterun](Whiterun%20(City)). It is a foundational text in the legal history of the Wajahe, and greatly influenced the [12th Dynasty](Chyowo%20Clan#The%2012th%20Dynasty).
### Book I - On the City & the State
##### Preface
The Stone City was put to shame, and the Legions of the old Exarchate were laid to rest in law and in land. In the turmoil of her fall, [Whiterun](Whiterun%20(City)) was cast into evening shadow, and smoke hung over her for many days and many nights. [[Ezzhé]] disdained the Stone City, and for 6 days and 18 nights, none could journey beneath the soil for fear of the God’s coldness, and the dead were lost to them for this time. When their contempt was allayed by the Archon and her priests, Ezzhé spoke unto the Archon, who spoke unto us, the authors of this code, that Ezzhé’s word may be put to paper for all to see, as [[Aiokkais]]’ was for our forefathers. So the Archon has said of this;

Prevailing against all the tribulations that have fallen upon the Stone City, the Most Holy Bastion of the Great Lord of the Earth, Just-Tyrant and First God of Mankind, Patron of Their Servants In Life and In Burial, the Stewards of that city, Whiterun, the Whiterun, Ezzhé, Sublime Seat of the Fifth Dynasties, from whence all Good Stone has been quarried, through which all Good Trade has passed, owing credence to Astute [[Kzletse]] who laid low That Stupid Fucking Hill, the Whiterun, who bask solely in Aiokkais’ joy of morning shadow, who withstand no scorn of evening shadow, who owe all glory and honor to the most sacred and venerable Ezzhé, Patron of the Stone City, Supreme Slavemaster to whom all our souls are justly owed, Keeper of the Dead, whom all who rule ought to imitate, drink yet again from the fresh and cool waters of their river, which flows forth from lands owed to themselves and carries upstream the souls of the less pious to that home of the Gods upon the Great Lake, and bask in the safety of their most sacred walls, hewn from the great stones granted unto them by their most just and judicious Patron to whom all praise is owed, with war having passed and the dead, their souls owed to the Slaver of the Deceased, having been buried. 

I, Solid Snake, bestowed my name by the wise hand of the gods at work in the minds of my birthparent, inerrant and immoveable as stone, that over which my most awesome Patron, Ezzhé, rules, Archon of Whiterun, that most glorious of cities, hewn of stone beyond compare, bestowed through the unending and ever-cherished Patronage of the Great Lord of all Upon and Beneath the World, joining in my most Sovereign station the offices of Chief of the ancient and venerable Whiterun Clan and High General of the ceaseless and incomparable armies of the Whiterun Clan, emergent from that which was once, but is no more, the Exarchate of [[Opshup]], and what were once, but are no longer, her Legions, who did do away with the deluded false Archons of the Second Fifth Dynasty before me, whose deluded heirs do rule over folly in the wastes beyond the Stone City, and who restored unto the Stone City venerable and wise leadership, owing all credence to the guidance of my ever-praiseworthy Patron, to whom my soul and the souls of my children and the souls of their children are owed, for whom all labors are intended to glorify and for whom and by whom the Stone City and the Fifth Dynasties have prospered, Ezzhé, and to the most glorious and indomitable sun, whose morning shadow has blessed thirty-six-fold the Stone City and all Wajahe knowing and unknowing, who brought into being the Great God Ezzhé and did bring until them discipline and wisdom in Just Tyranny, Aiokkais, so that that terrible cold which Ezzhé, in all rights as Patron of the Stone City and Keeper of the Dead, did send upon the crypts and quarries, which did keep the people from the dead in the crypts and the quarriers from the stone in their quarries, which did keep the slaveowners from their profits and the grieving from the grieved, may be allayed, and that the Stone City, in manners pleasing to Ezzhé, Just-Tyrant, through whom all laws ought be derived, according to whom all rulership ought be measured, may be beholden unto a great Code of Law.

Thus, unto the Stone City, I, Solid Snake, Archon by the hands of Ezzhé and Aiokkais, and of the brave soldiers who did fight for me, and of the serving dead who now toil under the great Patron of this city, bestow such a Code of Law, as was decreed unto me by the Great God of the World to be decreed unto it.

If a person lives within the walls of the Stone City, Whiterun, or else lives within two days’ travel by a swift steed from the walls of the Stone City, or else counts himself amongst the Whiterun Clan, or else is bound by oath or treaty, or else sits upon the Assembly Before the Archon, or else holds station in the armies of Whiterun, or else is bound through some other means, then it is written that his fealty is owed to the city of Whiterun, and to the [[Archon]], and to Ezzhé.

If a person, in service to the armies of Whiterun, attains the rank of General, and is, by most sacred decree of the Archon under the guidance of Ezzhé Most Great, proclaimed to be Heir Apparent, and remains a General at the time of the Archon’s passing, he shall be the new Archon. Or else, if no person is declared Heir Apparent, the Archon is to be proclaimed by the soldiery of Whiterun’s armies in concord with those who sit upon the Assembly Before the Archon.

8. If a person, granted authority, or granted office, by decree of the Archon of Whiterun, is accused of acting beyond the confines of his station, and it is found to be true, he shall be stripped of his station, and to pay a sum of silver marks unto his accuser to the Archon’s satisfaction. Yet if the accusation is deemed to be false, the accused may demand of his accuser sixfold the silver marks that he would have lost.
9. If a person, by conduct, or by proclamation, or by association, causes discredit unto the name of Ezzhé, Lord of the Land, such as by slander, or subversion of the commands of the priesthood, or beyond, he shall be made a slave for life, and all his wealth shall be shared amongst the priesthood, and all his properties shall be passed to the state, and he shall be branded with the name of Ezzhé upon his head by a hot iron, and his beasts shall be put to death, and any horse he has ridden shall be declared impure, and he shall be afforded a poor burial, that his soul shall serve Ezzhé forevermore upon his miserable death.

### Book III - On Land
1. If an area of land exists within the walls of the Stone City, or within two days’ travel by a swift steed from the walls of the Stone City, it is, in the absence of deed, or of proclamation, or of long-standing reason for exception, property of the Whiterun clan in its totality, realised through the direct ownership of the state.
2. If an area of land has no deed, whatsoever is upon the land is may not be presented as having definite value for sale, for a deed is necessary to establish what rights the Whiterun clan is prepared to grant unto a tenant, and to establish the value of what is upon the land, and to establish what rights such value falls under, and to establish what responsibilities may be conferred upon the tenant.
3. If no deed exists for an area of land, the Whiterun clan, manifest through the Archon, may produce and ratify a deed, setting forth all the rights and responsibilities that fall upon the land, or else any person may produce a deed, and, producing a sum of silver marks equal to half the assumed value of the land, and having had their evaluation appraised by one acting on behalf of the state, request that the Archon ratify the deed, bringing it into law. Supposing a deed has not been ratified, it is worthless.
4. If a person purchases an area of land, he shall be entitled to, at most, a maximum number of rights never meeting the totality of the land, for the state, prior to and beyond all transactions, shall retain the deed itself, and shall also retain the Clannish Right, which may only be held in law by the Whiterun clan. Should it be said that a person purchases a deed, it is as such that he did not, yet that he purchased all rights but the Clannish Right.
5. If a person is found to have forged a ratified deed for land, or has been found in possession of a forgery, all privy to the forgery shall be put to death by entombment whilst still alive, and their deed shall be destroyed.
6. If a person is found to have caused some obfuscation of the nature of a deed relating to land in his ownership, or land which he wishes to own, or land which is owned by his enemy, he shall be made a slave, and if he obfuscated his own deed, it shall be destroyed, or else if he obfuscated another’s deed in pursuit of his land, its terms shall be proclaimed publicly, or else if he obfuscated his enemy’s deed, his enemy shall be entitled to purchase whatever rights the obfuscator owned at discount equal to half the obfuscator’s wealth in silver marks.
7. If a person is found to have sold land, or rights to land, or tenancy upon land, or to have hired laborers to work upon land, in the absence of a ratified deed for the land, or for rights to the land, or for tenancy upon the land, or to hire laborers to work upon the land, he shall be made a slave, and all that it is theirs within the walls of the Stone City, or else is theirs within two days’ ride by a swift steed from the walls of the Stone City, or else is theirs by contract, or else is theirs by oath, or else is theirs by deed, or else is theirs by estate, or else is theirs by logue, shall pass to the ownership of the Whiterun clan, and his deed shall be destroyed.
8. If a person is found to have purchased land, or rights to land, or tenancy upon land, or to have been hired as a laborer to work upon land, in the absence of a ratified deed for the land, or for rights to the land, or for tenancy upon the land, or to hire laborers to work upon the land, he shall receive a number of lashes equal to twelvefold the number of days he was present upon the land for any time and for any purpose.
9. If a person is found to have sold whatever rights he has purchased under a deed without receiving the explicit consent of the Whiterun clan to do so, by agreement of the Archon or a delegated representative, he shall have that which he sold returned to him, and whatever wealth he acquired in the sale shall be conveyed unto the state, or else receive a number of lashes twelvefold the number of silver marks he had received.
10. If a person is found to have purchased from another whatever rights were conferred to them in a deed without the one they have purchased from having received the express consent of the Whiterun clan to do so, by agreement of the Archon or a delegated representative, he shall be made to return that which he had purchased to the salesperson, or else face a number of lashes sixfold the number of silver marks he had paid to the salesperson.
11. If a person is found to have, whether by conduct, or by proclamation, or by association, acted in a manner which demeans or diminishes the ownership of the Whiterun clan over all land held in deeds, he shall, if he is judged to be True, be judged to be False, or else he was judged to be False, and he shall be made a slave, and all that it is theirs within the walls of the Stone City, or else is theirs within two days’ ride by a swift steed from the walls of the Stone City, or else is theirs by contract, or else is theirs by oath, or else is theirs by deed, or else is theirs by estate, or else is theirs by logue, shall pass to his heir, who shall be made to publicly assert the ownership of the Whiterun clan over all deeds they are party to.
12. If a person in ownership of a number of rights under a deed, with the explicit permission of the Whiterun clan, as given by the Archon or a delegated representative, exchanges his rights to another individual, whether as a gift or in a transaction, it shall be recognised as valid by the state.
13. If a deed recognizes a number of responsibilities relating to an area of land, whosoever holds those responsibilities is obliged to tend to them, so that some duty in service of the common good is conferred onto them. Responsibilities for land are to be transferred through sale of rights under a deed, or else by costless transfer from the Whiterun clan to the tenant of a deed, or else by petition to the Archon from the tenant of a deed.
14. If the rights contained within one deed seem to interfere with the rights contained within another deed, supposing both deeds have tenants, the deed with the oldest tenancy shall prevail, or else if there is only one tenant, that deed shall prevail, or else if there are no tenants, the oldest deed of the two shall prevail.
15. If a person indulges in rights contained within a deed without being in ownership of the rights, and without express permission from the holder of the rights, he shall be made a slave for a sum of years found satisfactory by the victim in accordance with the value of the rights infringed upon, and the victim, supposing the victim is not the state, may purchase him, discounting from his value that of the rights infringed upon.
16. If the Archon makes a proclamation of entitlement, an area of land, not already falling under a deed, or a number of deeds, shall be recognized as an estate, which shall confer the totality of an area of land, which is to be called the demesne, to whomever the estate is granted within the proclamation, who must be judged as True.
17. If an area of land falls under an estate as the estate’s demesne, it cannot be said to have any definite value for sale, as an estate cannot be sold, and as the demesne of an estate has no rights, being the totality of the land.
18. If the Archon proclaims an estate as having a unique means of succession and inheritance, the estate shall operate according to the proclamation rather than according to any other means of succession or inheritance, or else, supposing no unique means are proclaimed, the estate shall be beholden to the means of succession and inheritance seen in deeds.
19. If the Archon proclaims duties to be fulfilled within an estate in a proclamation of entitlement, and these duties go unfulfilled by whomever holds the estate, the proclamation of entitlement may be revoked, and the person who held the estate may be fined half the assumed value of the estate had it been rendered under a deed.
20. If an estate exists under a proclamation of entitlement, the Archon may, with the consent of the estate holder, or else under guidance from members of the Assembly Before the Archon, issue a subsequent proclamation of entitlement to alter the nature of the estate, such as to introduce duties or change the boundaries of the estate’s demesne.
21. If a person in ownership of an estate is found to have misrepresented the estate, or the estate’s demesne, as land held under a deed, the proclamation of entitlement shall be rescinded, and he shall be judged as False.
22. If a person acts as to benefit from an estate, or the demesne of an estate, without the permission of the owner of the estate, he shall be made a slave for a sum of years found satisfactory by the victim in accordance with the value of the rights infringed upon, and the victim, supposing the victim is not the state, may purchase him, discounting from his value that of the rights infringed upon.
23. If an area of land has been recognized as being held in means contrary to deeds and to estates, and it has been as such for a time exceeding the rule of the last three Archons of Whiterun, the area of land shall be recognized as belonging, in its totality, excepting the Clannish Right, to whomsoever claims it, who shall be protected by an exception in writing.
24. If a person whose land is protected by an exception in writing purchases rights under a deed of an adjoining area of land, his exception in writing shall be subsumed into the adjoining deed, which shall be revalued and redrawn according to the incorporation.
25. If an area of land is found to cast evening shadow upon another area of land, or else cause some lesser damage to a neighboring area of land, any deed or estate encompassing this area of land shall involve a duty to mitigate this harm, or else the harm shall be remedied by the state.
26. If a person causes damage to the land, or else to the rights of the land, held under deed, or under proclamation, or under exception in writing, he has committed vandalism, and he shall be made a slave of the state, and lashed until the satisfaction of the victim, yet should he die from the lashings, the victim should be taken as a slave in his place.
27. If the ordinary course of succession for any land, whether under deed, or under proclamation, or under exception in writing, is rendered impossible, the land shall pass in its totality to the state.

### Book IV - On Goods
1.

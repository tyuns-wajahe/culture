The Predynastic period was the span of recorded history before the establishment of the [1st Dynasty](Ksehen%20Clan#The%20First%20Dynasty). Following [[The Ksehyl]], a major trend of this period is clan consolidation and centralization. Eventually, alongside urbanization, clans would resemble early, decentralized states, that would begin to interact with and invade neighboring civilizations in an organized fashion. The Wajahe would invent (or possibly adapt) writing during this period, which would spread to the other major civilizations of the day. This would also be the period in which the overriding character of the Wajahe as a martial civilization would be fully cemented - and fittingly, the predynastic period would end after a major conflict against the [[Ejee]] empire centered at the then-[[Dajitti]] city of [[Koshayis]] - which the Wajahe would handily defeat and conquer.

### From the Steppe to the Lakes

At the beginning of this period, there were 2 distinct groups of Wajahe - the Steppe Wajahe and the Lake Wajahe. The Steppe Wajahe were fully nomadic, while the Lake Wajahe were semi-nomadic - the former is typically associated with [[Bemwe De]] and the [[Bwuzde]] while the latter is typically associated with [[Bemwe Gehan]] and the [[Chuzde]]. There were substantial differences in the material culture of these two peoples as is preserved in the archaeological record, and it is assumed they spoke the same language.

Around 250 KS, there was a major conflict - **The Contest of Chiefs** - between several clans of the Steppe Wajahe (in the mythologized telling, a group of vacant clans that were led by the [[Bwuzde]]) and the [[Wzetsyew]]. The Steppe Wajahe were defeated and largely driven out of their land. From their Steppe homeland, they went westwards into the Lakes, intermixing with with the Lake Wajahe - from this point onwards, the two mix sufficiently to be considered one people. During this period, there are frequently clashes with the [[Zuu6]] people, against whom the [[Tim Clan]] of the Wajahe would eventually prevail (and conquer).

### The First Dynasty

The Predynastic period would end with the establishment of the 1st Dynasty of the Wajahe, which was a confederacy between the [[Ksehen Clan]] and the [[Nla Clan]] (as well as the remnants of the [[Tim Clan]]). 

Note that dynasty here doesn't refer to a lineage, but rather a cohesive period of rule by a major state. 
### Notes

- Towards the end of this period, the [Kih Wajahe](Tim%20Clan) emerge as a separate Wajahic people in the steppe. Their decline was contemporaneous with the collapse of the 1st dynasty.
- [Chariots](Chariot.md), [[Wool Processing]] and [[Glass and Glaze]] were some notable technologies developed by the Wajahe during this period.

The wœɥø͡uɥ have been, since ancient times, divided along the structure of the wut͡ʃakʷøɥ (henceforth referred to as Clan): a loose grouping of families that had a traditional claim to a portion of livestock. At this period of time, we see the wœɥø͡uɥ in flux: in some portions of the land occupied by the culture, the institution of the Clan has evolved into a precursor of a sedentary city state, while in others, Clans remain nomadic institutions, that hold livestock communally and move around vast swathes of land for the horses to graze across.

Before exploring various clans on the map, it is important to divide clans into categories, for easier classification (it is necessary to note that the clans do not view themselves along these divisions, and it is simply a matter of classification).
- **Chiefdoms**: These are clans that have a hereditary [chief](Clan%20Chief) as its (at least nominal) ruler. A family identity is extremely important among these clans, even when dealing with outsiders (or other Clans), and the communal holding of agricultural land / livestock is typically on a family level. These tend to be centered around a village or a cluster of villages.
- **Nomadic clans**: these clans also have a chief, but the position is not hereditary, and instead chosen by [clan elders](Clan%20Elders) from young and popular warriors, and remains beholden to the elders as their source of power. These are based on more traditional steppe Clans, and hold all livestock communally within the clan while making no claim to a stretch of land and instead moving around large areas of grazing land. These do not value a family identity: frequently if a single family gains significant influence over the clan, they will be removed from it to form their own clan.
- **[Vacant Clans](Vacant%20Clan)**: These are clans where the position of Chief is vacant, from the days prior to the defeat of the [bʷwɯzðɛ](Bwuzde). These can be both sedentary or nomadic, and while they nominally hold the bʷwɯzðɛ as their chief, for all intents the clan is controlled by its elders and the bʷwɯzðɛ does not have any influence at all. (There are no vacant clans remaining that hold the [ʈ͡ʂɯzðɛ](Chuzde) as their nominal chief, all have since returned to a hereditary line of chiefs, birthmother to child).

As a final note, major settlements (those marked on the map) tend to be named after their clan.

1. **[/nla/](Nla%20Clan) (Chiefdom)** - The nla, bordering the θɛnækʷyɥøʁitɛ (river people), are the Clan most influenced by their culture. Here, the basic structure of the Clan almost begins to break down, with the institution of “guilds” from the west defining the division of roles more than the traditional clan hierarchy. The seat of Clan power is along the lake.
2. **/lekɛtka͡osθøɥ/ (Chiefdom)** - This clan is also heavily influenced by the θɛnækʷyɥøʁitɛ, but despite sharing a longer border with the river people, most of the population is centered along the lake, with the western portions being used almost exclusively as grazing land. Here, border conflicts with the river people are frequent, and has resulted in the lekɛtka͡osθøɥ having a reputation as fierce warriors and fine bowyers.
3. **/ʈ͡ʂɯkɛtiɥ/ (Chiefdom)** - Taking the name from the tree growing along the lake shores, the ʈ͡ʂɯkɛtiɥ in their forest are among the smaller clans, living mostly off fishing from the lake. The population is centered almost entirely in the settlement on the lake, and livestock is limited, though a significant cluster of smaller settlements do exist on the eastern bank of the river as seen.
4. **/ʈ͡ʂa͡owza͡oɥ/ (Chiefdom)** - The ʈ͡ʂa͡owza͡oɥ have the best agricultural land among the wœɥø͡uɥ. Through trade, they exchange their oats, millets, and vegetables for pottery and metalwork from the east and south. They also trade with the river folk.
5. **/wø͡uza͡oɥ/ (Chiefdom)** - With their ancestral roots in the frigid northern reaches of the steppe, the clan maintains their reputation as cold, callous warriors, despite their new environment being the polar opposite of the old. The entire clan subsists off fishing, with their major cluster of settlements existing along the narrow connection between the ʈ͡ʂɯwzɯɥzɥœɥ and ʁᵝɯwzɯɥzɥœɥ lakes. They are the most frequent source of troubles for their neighbors, especially as their geography makes them difficult to raid in retaliation.
6. **/bɛmɰɛ/ (Clan of the [bʷwɯzðɛ](Bwuzde))** - Taking its name from their legendary founder, the bɛmɰɛ are nominally the most prestigious clan among the wœɥø͡uɥ, but in reality are among the least influential. All wœɥø͡uɥ believe that [ʍøkɛ](Aiokkais) will elevate every bʷwɯzðɛ to [become a god upon their death](The%20Wajahe%20Pantheon#The%20Younger%20Gods), which lends them a degree of spiritual influence. They remain mostly nomadic, but tend to exercise full control over their marked portion of grazing land.
7. **/nigim/ (Chiefdom)** - Named after the geese for whom this portion of land is an important stop in the migration, the /nigim/ were until recently a vacant clan, but after a series of protracted skirmishes with the /bɛmɰɛ/, have elevated a chief of their own.
8. **[/gɛwan/](Ksehen%20Clan) (Clan of the [ʈ͡ʂɯzðɛ](Chuzde))** - Also taking their name from their legendary founder, the /gɛwan/ already had their decline, and have come out the other side as a significant regional power on the ʁᵝɯwzɯɥzɥœɥ. They are the most populated and influential clan, and tend to be a cultural center for the wœɥø͡uɥ. All wœɥø͡uɥ believe that [ʍøkɛ](Aiokkais) will elevate every ʈ͡ʂɯzðɛ to become a god upon their death, which lends them a degree of spiritual influence. Yet, the days of vacant clans holding the ʈ͡ʂɯzðɛ as their chief are long gone.
9. **/t͡sewzɯt/ (Chiefdom)** - Named for the saddle, this clan is a mix of nomadic horsemen and settled folk along the lake. It is expected by their neighbors that they will soon split into multiple clans, and continue to have their grazing and farm land encroached on by their neighbors.
10. **[/tim/](Tim%20Clan) (Vacant Clan)** - The /tim/ are a recent migrant to the south, after raiding and occupying land from the [katniketɛ](Zuu6). They are slowly sedenterizing, and have split into two halves, both calling themselves the /tim/. Both are renowned for their metalwork, and are centers of trade and influence in the mostly nomadic east.
11. (as above) - This branch of the /tim/ are more influenced by the [katniketɛ](Zuu6); in fact, a lot of their population are former katniketɛ captives that demonstrated their mastery over the horse and were inducted into the clan.

A. **Western Nomadic Clans**
This is a grouping of several nomadic clans, over the range of land they use for grazing. For the most part, these are in the process of slowly sedenterizing. Of the more than 7 clans represented here, the most influential are certainly the /wuzɥø͡uɥnɛ/ and the /ŋa/, both of which hold on strongly to their nomadic ways. In fact, the two are usually engaged in some form of warfare with each other, and the other clans here are caught in the sidelines. These clans are also well known for their mercenary warriors, who will join neighboring chiefs in battle in exchange for a share of the loot.

B. **Eastern Nomadic Clans**
This is a grouping of several nomadic clans, over the range of land they use for grazing. These clans have recently defeated the katniketɛ and driven them out of this land, and use it for grazing. All are nomadic, though some are looking to follow in the footsteps of the /tim/ Clans, both of which have become extremely influential from their metal production and trade. There are far too many to list here. Most clans here remain vacant. 
Conflict between clans over new grazing land is constant in this portion of the wœɥø͡uɥ, and their neighbors in the /t͡sewzɯt/ and the /tim/ are often involved in these conflicts, raiding to seize livestock or capture control over land potentially useful for agriculture.

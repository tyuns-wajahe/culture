The **Hisitse Civil Wars** are a series of 3 conflicts taking place between 2507 and 2553 KS. After [[The Imyes Plague]], the [3rd Dynasty](Hisitse%20Clan#Third%20Dynasty) state with its base of power in [[Hisitse Clan]] underwent a complete collapse, leading to the clan and city itself being divided between rival powers for nearly 5 decades.

### First Civil War
The first civil war was a result of the Imyes Plague. The Clan of Hisitse was unable to keep up with rebellions in various clans after the plague spread quickly across their military where it was unusually deadly. After the conflict, [[Tsepwe Clan]], [[Hkshit Clan]], and the [5th Dynasty](Whiterun%20Clan#5th%20Dynasty) each supported an individual faction of the clan's military. The city itself fell under the influence of Hkshit at the end of this conflict, though this would only last for 12 years.

### Second Civil War
The second civil war took place in 2519 KS. It began as a proxy conflict between Tsepwe and Hkshit. The faction in Hisitse aligned with Tsepwe laid siege to the city, which was held by the faction aligned with Hkshit. However, around this point, the 5th Dynasty had entered a loose alliance with Hkshit, focused on stopping expansion by Tsepwe. As a a result, the faction of Hisitse aligned with the 5th dynasty attacked the besieging forces, driving them off.

During this battle, a few soldiers from Tsepwe who were there primarily to advise and oversee the siege were taken captive. This was enough precedent for Tsepwe to escalate the conflict, and they invaded and besieged Hkshit. Forces from the 5th Dynasty entered from the east to open another front, but were unable to effectively capture the lightly garrisoned border fortifications, before the city of Hkshit fell. The armies of Tsepwe then turned back around to invade east, and captured a few border fortifications but were unable to make serious inroads into the territory of the [[Whiterun Clan]] proper. In addition, all advances made towards the [[Ihwtsrksiw]] to join the conflict were rebuffed, as they had recently suffered a defeat on a border raid against one of the successor states to the [[Kapapt]], the [[Bepatj]] (which was only just beginning to emerge).

At the same time as the conflict's escalation, the armies of the Tsepwe-aligned faction regrouped and pushed first against the 5th Dynasty-aligned faction. They were able to win a non-decisive victory which drove that faction off to the hinterland long enough for them to amount an assault on the city, which they quickly won. As a result, the Hisitse-aligned faction was completely defeated. Much of its hinterland actually fell to the 5th Dynasty-aligned faction, as the Tsepwe-aligned faction scrambled to assert control over the city - this resulted in the 5th Dynasty-aligned faction controlling most of the rural land of the clan, and therefore most of the manpower available to it, while the Tsepwe-aligned faction held the city but was slowly starved for men and resources. This would lay the stage for the third civil war, in 34 years, after the first generation of warriors in the conflict had all retired.
### Interwar Period
The interwar period was characterized by significant raids and failed assaults on the city by the 5th dynasty-aligned faction, none of which were decisive either way. Neither side was willing to escalate this beyond a proxy war, as a strengthened [[Yerzhay Clan]] in the west and continued raids from the [[Ihwtsrksiw]] in the east kept Tsepwe and the 5th Dynasty respectively busy. 

### Third Civil War
The Third Civil war began in 2553 KS. It was overall fairly anticlimactic - it started as just another raid; however, during the conflict, the general leading the 5th dynasty-aligned faction was slain in the battle, leading to a rout; and the Tsepwe-aligned faction sallied out to chase the soldiers down. This was wildly successful, and led to the vast majority of the 5th dynasty-aligned faction's army being captured. As a result, the Tsepwe-aligned faction was able to conquer the hinterland with ease in a matter of days, before the 5th Dynasty could even muster a force to respond.

Following this, Hisitse clan would be united and fall under formal subordination to the Tsepwe Clan. 2553 is therefore one of the three dates used to mark the origins of the 6th Dynasty - though the 2592 date remains more common.

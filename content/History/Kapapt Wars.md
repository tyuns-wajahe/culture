The **Kapapt Wars** were two conflicts between Wajahe States and the [[Kapapt]], between 2437 and 2441 KS.
### First Kapapt War
In 2437 KS, the [3rd Dynasty](Hisitse%20Clan#Third%20Dynasty), a state on the rise, had very publicly set its sights on the conquest of the remnants of the [[4th Dynasty]], centered on the [ʈ͡ʂʷɥɔwɔ Clan](Chyowo%20Clan). ʈ͡ʂʷɥɔwɔ, knowing full well that they could not defeat their stronger neighbors, requested help from the [Riverine](The%20Riverine%20Culture) empire of kəpəpt to the South - the dominant political power of the day.

kəpəpt agreed to send an army north to counterattack the hisit͡se, in exchange for a formalized vassalage of ʈ͡ʂʷɥɔwɔ to the Riverine guilds. However, hisit͡se fully expected an incursion from the south, and was able to defend their land with a decisive victory near some well-placed fortifications. This was followed up by a complete conquest of ʈ͡ʂʷɥɔwɔ, as well as a slight incursion southwards to expand the fortifications.

### Second Kapapt War
hisit͡sɛ and [hʷwɨɥtr̩n](Whiterun%20Clan) were both not pleased by the Riverrine incursion into what they viewed as Wajahe affairs, and decided to conduct a joint raid southwards, to teach these damnable foreigners a lesson.

Attacking southwards, the Riverine armies were routed in quick fashion, and all 3 cities laid to siege. The sieges were quick and relatively painless for the Wajahe, which of course meant significant destruction to many riverine cities, and large scale looting. There was no attempt at or desire for conquest - the warriors captured anything of wealth that was not nailed down, and carted it back home. This included many children, who were taken captive and raised back home as Wajahe, to become auxiliary warriors in later wars.

This war caused the immediate collapse of the Kapapt. The successor states would retain a degree of confederal cohesion until [[The Imyes Plague]], after which the Kapapt fully ceased to exist (and would be replaced by the [[Bepatj]] after around 2 centuries).

An important story from this war was that of the Great Library at [Shansjédj](Shanshyotozh%20(City).md). Some warriors came to sack and loot this too, however, a retired Wajahe warrior who was learning there stood up against these warriors, and convinced them that it was wrong of them to attack a center of knowledge and learning, and that there was no glory in the deaths of defenseless scribes. This story is a foundational piece for some later philosophical traditions.

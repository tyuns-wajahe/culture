The **Wajahic Languages** are a family of languages spoken by the Wajahe.

Members include:
- i.t͡sɛ̃hʷ.kn̩l - The language of the Lake Wajahe.
- it͡s.næz.ʋyk - The language of the Lower River Wajahe.
- itʷ.ʋɛs.t͡swel - The language of the Middle and Upper River Wajahe.
- Igiichi (or u.hʷo.ʂə.hʷuɥ) - The language of the [[Imyes]].
- Old Imyes - The language of the Imyes prior to their migration, which is unrelated to the above (extinct).

It is important to note that the [Jağefjāz Rešadzekw](Jagefja) language is not Wajahic and instead Efic. In addition, the language of [Svr](Svr-Ksehen) is not Wajahic but instead derives from the [[Ejee]] language.

All Wajahic languages have used a group of related scripts across their history, typically taking the form of the Abjad - see [[Wajahic Scripts]].
